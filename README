What does the name "Tiro" mean?
================================

Tiro is named after Macrus Tillius Tiro who was a Roman slave owned by
Cicero.  He figures prominently in the early history of the notary
profession which is appropriate given that he Tiro program is
effectively a notarizer for assignment submissions.

Macrus Tillius Tiro invented the shorthand system of 'notae
Tironianae' (Tironian notes).  Originally, a 'notarius' (notary) was
anyone who used the shorthand system.  The shorthand system allowed
the recording of statements and meetings in real-time which led
to the notarii being official record keepers.  Thus the meaning of
the term 'notarius' shifted to mean an official records keeper or one
who certifies documents and eventually the modern term, 'notary'.
