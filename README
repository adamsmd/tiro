Future features:
* Critical
 - Perl version detection for "say"
 - Install guide
 - file_name regex (as validator)
 - config file validator
 - active vs. non-active folders
 - Admin interface (but be clear what it looks like to student)
 - Server Time offset

 - Report back search params
 - text/plain on file download (regex)
 - config "Select" and "Folder" text
   - Change "folder" to "assignment"
   - Change "browse" to "select"(?)

* Non-critical
 - Print server time on pages
 - hilight "overdue" in red or bold
 - Upload chmod for group? (as silent validator?)
 - HTML formatting / CSS classes
 - Download tar-ball.
 - Use path_info() to dispatch upload, download and pre-upload(?)
 - Full URL to cgi.cs.indiana.edu? url()
 - struct for checker names?
 - Folder edit: link under browse?, new (link under browse), delete, active, rename, validate config
 - Hilight sorted column
 - Clickable sorted column
 - file size with commas

 - Put "multi-selectable" under Users and Folders search box

* Rejected ideas (unless someone has a good reason to include them)
 - Check box for show upload form
 - select subset of checkers to run
 - detailed sort-by
 - Separate upload page (so full assignment can be listed)

NOTES:
 - if you want to validate filenames, write an external checker
 - group work is possible if you symlink the right assignment folders together

Thanks to the testers:
