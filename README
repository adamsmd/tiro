Model
Database Representation





## Design Principals
 The system is designed to be small with minimal requirements and a backend
 data representation that is trival to manipulate.
 
- Data must not be lost:
  If a student submits a file, we had better receive it.
  In the case of catastrophic failure student submissions should
  be accessable without needing special tools.
- Data must not be leaked:
  A student's assignment should not be accessable to unauthorized people.
  We don't want one student stealing another students submission.
- Data must be authentic:
  We don't want students to be able forge a submissions.
- Solutions should be as simple as possible and have minimal requirements:
  We don't want to have a complicated database represenation
  or require the installation of obscure software.

## Model
- Users
  - Authentication via HTTP and .htaccess
    - User Override
  - Properties
    - Admins
    - Username
    - Fullname
    - Expiration
  - From global config or CSV
- Assignments
  - 
  - Due date
- Submissions


## Database Representation

- global_config.json - Holds the global configuration.  Location specified by DIR constant in upload.cgi.
- folder_configs/ - Contains 
  - assignment1
  - assignment2
- folder_files/
  - assignment1/
    - user1/
      - 2010-01-01T00:00:00/
        - file1
        - file2
      - 2010-01-02T00:00:00/
        - file1
        - file2
    - user2/ - 
  - assignment2/ - 

## Tips and Tricks
- if you want to validate filenames, write an external checker
- group work is possible if you symlink the right assignment folders together
- The assignment text can be used to store complete assignment descriptions
  or just quick notes on assignment description depending on how you want
  to use it.
- Number of submissions is listed for admin users
- Users and Folders are multi-selectable
- Start and end dates can be any format parsable by Date::Manip.
- To find students who haven't submitted, change the Status to search
  not "Not Submitted".
- Checks run automaticaly when student submits, but they
  can still be run later by checking the "Run checks" option in the search
  or by clicking "[check]" in the list of previously uploaded files.
- Checkers get the same standard out and standard err as the CGI script
  so anything printed to standard out will be sent to the web browser
  and anything printed to standard error will be sent to the webserver's
  error log.

What does the name "Tiro" mean?
================================

Tiro is named after Macrus Tillius Tiro who was a Roman slave owned by
Cicero.  He figures prominently in the early history of the notary
profession which is appropriate given that he Tiro program is
effectively a notarizer for assignment submissions.

Macrus Tillius Tiro invented the shorthand system of 'notae
Tironianae' (Tironian notes).  Originally, a 'notarius' (notary) was
anyone who used the shorthand system.  The shorthand system allowed
the recording of statements and meetings in real-time which led
to the notarii being official record keepers.  Thus the meaning of
the term 'notarius' shifted to mean an official records keeper or one
who certifies documents and eventually the modern term, 'notary'.
