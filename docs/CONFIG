## Configuration ##

There are three sorts of configuration for Tiro:
 - global configuration,
 - assignment configuration, and
 - user configuration.

Global configurations are stored in system/config.cfg.  (This is
determined by the CONFIG_FILE constant in tiro.cgi and can be changed
if you wish.)

Assignment configurations are files stored in the assignments/ directory.
Each file in the assignments/ folder represents a single assignment
and contains the configuration for that assignment.

User configurations are stored in the CSV (comma-separated value) file
specified by the 'users_file' setting in the global configuration.
Additional users can also be specified directly in the global
configuration.

## Configuration File Format ##

Both the global configuration file and the assignment configuration
files use the same format.  A configuration file start with a header
made up of multiple lines.  The header ends at the first blank line.
(A line with only white space counts as a blank line.)  Everything
after the header counts as the body.  The body is unstructured text.

Header lines consist of a key and a value separated by the first
colon (':') on the line.
White space at the start and end of the key and value is trimmed
and ignored.
The same key may be duplicated multiple times.
For keys representing scalar properties, only the last value has effect.
But for keys representing list properties, each value becomes
a separate element of the list.

Header lines that don't contain colons are ignored.  So any line that
doesn't contain a colon or uses an unknown key is effectively a
comment.  In general keys should not start with hash ('#') so that
lines starting with a hash are effectively always comments regardless
of whether they contain a colon.

## Global Configuration

By default the global configuration is stored in system/config.cfg,
but this can be overridden by setting CONFIG_FILE in tiro.cgi.

title (required): The title that should be displayed at the top of all pages.

working_dir (defaults to the same directory):
  the working directory from which tiro.cgi should
path (defaults to /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin): 
 - path: (String) The environment PATH that checkers should run with.
max_post_size (defaults to 10000):
 - post_max: (Integer) The maximum number of bytes allowed to be uploaded.
date_format (defaults to "%a, %b %d %Y, %r"):
log_file (defaults to "system/log/log-%Y-%m-%d.txt"):

assignments_dir (defaults to "assignments"):
  The path to the directory containing folder configuration files.
assignments_regex (defaults to "^(\w+)\.cfg$"):
 - folder_configs_ignore: (String) A Perl regular expression.  Files in the
   folder_configs directory are ignored if they match this regular expression.
submissions_dir (defaults to "submissions"):

admins (list, defaults to the empty list):
 - admins: (List of String) The users that are application administrators.
     They can see uploads by other users.
user_override (defaults to the empty string):
users (list, defaults to the empty list):
 - users: (Dictionary) Maps each usernames (as a string) to
   a dictionary that represents the configuration settings for that user.
   That dictionary contains the following keys mapping to the described values.
   - full_name: (String) The full name of the user.
     Only used for display purposes.
   - expires: (String) The date afterwhich this user should no longer be
     allowed access.  Any date format parsable by Date::Manip is allowed.
users_file (defaults to the empty string):
user_name_column (defaults to the empty string):
user_full_name_column (defaults to the empty string):
user_expires_column (defaults to the empty string):
users_header_lines (defaults to "0"):

text (defaults to the empty string)

Most configuration will have only the following settings:

## Assignment Configuration ##

The identifier for the folder configuration is taken from the file name
of the folder configuration file.

By default assignments are stored in the assignments/ folder, but this
can be overridden by setting assignments_dir in the global
configuration file.

  assignments_dir => 'assignments',
  assignments_regex => qr[^(\w+)\.cfg$],



title (required): The assignment title
- title: (String) The friendly name for the folder.  Only used for display purposes.

hidden_until (defaults to the empty string):
due (defaults to the empty string):
- due: (String) The date that the folder is due.  Any date format parsabel by Date::Manip is allowed.
file_count (defaults to the empty string):
- file_count: (Number) The number of file uploads to allow.
validators (list, defaults to the empty list):
- checkers: (Array) A list of checkers to run on submissions for this folder.
    Each element of the array is itself a two element array.
    - The first element is a string indicating the name of the checker.
      The first element only used for display purposes.
    - The second element is the program to run for the checker and
      is represented as an array of strings.
      The first string is the program the other strings are the arguments
      to the program.  The directory containing a particular submission
      is passed as a final argument after the arguments specified in this array.

text_file (defaults to the empty string):

text (defaults to the empty string)
- text: (String) HTML code that is inserted after the title and before the upload form.  The HTML code is placed in a <div> and is usually a description of the folder or any special instructions the user should now before uploading.
