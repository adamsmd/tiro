  Set permissions.

- Configure your server to use HTTPS authentication
  - On most Apache installations this is as simple as editing
    cgi-pub/.htaccess to contain the following lines and making sure
    the .htaccess has group and world read permissions:
      <Files tiro.cgi>
      AuthType KerberosV5
      AuthName "UITS Network ID"
      Require valid-user
      </Files>
