## Manual Installation
- Create a directory under your cgi-pub for tiro.  Say, cgi-pub/tiro/.
- Copy the tiro.cgi file as wells as the
  assignments, submissions and system directories.

- VERY IMPORTANT: Configure your folder permissions.
  On Apache this is done via .htaccess.
  TODO.
  Set permissions.

- Configure your server to use HTTPS authentication
  - On most Apache installations this is as simple as editing
    cgi-pub/.htaccess to contain the following lines and making sure
    the .htaccess has group and world read permissions:
      <Files tiro.cgi>
      AuthType KerberosV5
      AuthName "UITS Network ID"
      Require valid-user
      </Files>

- Configure your installation.  See the Configuration section of this document.
